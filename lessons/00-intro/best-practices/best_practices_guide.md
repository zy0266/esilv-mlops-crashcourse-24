# Best Practices Guide

## Intro

As we saw in the introduction to MLOps, enabling easy collaboration in a project is a hard task. Among other things we need to:

- Guarantee the reproducibility of the code in different environments
- Make it easy for all developers to read and understand code
- Detect mistakes and bugs that are hidden in the code

In this guide, we will cover some of the important steps to fix these problems.

## Code structure

The use of python scripts is almost always prefered to notebooks when we want to ensure the reproducibility and clarity of the code. Notebooks are a great tool to perform exploration and quickly test some aspects of the code. However, scripts allow for more modularity in development and allow a more ligthweight environment to be run.

Going from notebooks to scripts is, by itself, a simple task. However, it can also be the very first time that we are confronted with a project structure. The goal here is to present one of the many possible ways of structuring a project. Here is a quick overview of all the components that we usually employ during a project:

```
├── .github                       <- Where we set up interactions with GitHub such as actions and templates
├── .gitlab-ci.yml                <- Where we define a CI if we are using GitLab instead of GitHub(continouse integration)
├── docs                          <- Project documentation, often generated automatically by tools like `Sphinx` or `mkdocs`
├── config                        <- Config variables stored in yaml, toml or py files
├── lib                           <- Main Package. This is where the code lives. Sometimes it is also called `src`
│   ├── main.py                   <- Entrypoint
│   ├── lib1                      <- Library functions 1
│   │   ├── {file1}.py            <- 1st library script
│   │   └── {file1}.py            <- 2nd library script
│   ├── lib2                      <- Library functions 2
│   └── utils                     <- Where utils scripts and functions live (shared across libs)
├── notebooks                     <- Where the jupyter notebooks are stored
├── tests                         <- Where the tests live
├── Dockerfile                    <- Project containerization
├── requirements.in               <- Python packages used by project
├── requirements.txt              <- Automatically generated requirements (adding all nested dependencies from requirements.in)
├── environment.yml               <- Conda environment file (specifying virtual env name, python version and python packages)
├── .gitignore                    <- Files not to be tracked
├── pyproject.toml                <- Package configuration also used to configure tools such as linters, etc
├── Makefile                      <- Commands to ease up development cycle
└── README.md                     <- The top-level README for developers using this project
```

Every project has its own needs and might not require all of these files or might ask for new ones. Indeed, this very repository does not follow this exact structure to accomodate for the specificities of this lecture. However, increasing the standardization of the placement of these files is crucial to ensure that any developer can quickly read and understand your work in the future.

### Demo

- Check out the structure of this folder and navigate the files to see what is there and what is missing

## Python virtual environments

The first step to run python code is always to create a separated environment to run it.

### Motivations

Here are some common development issues:

- Many developers are involved in the same project, but work with different Python version. They might obtain different results while executing similar code
- Critical packages are installed on the development server, but are missing on the production server
- Conflicts in library versions among different projects

In order to avoid these embarrassing situations, the project configuration needs to be explicit so that results are reproducible (on a local or remote server, by any developer, ...).

> That's why any project must come with its virtual environment that is responsible for managing the Python version, as well as all the dependencies.

A virtual environment is always summarized in a requirements.txt (pip-fashion) or a environment.yml (conda-fashion) file, located at the root of the project. It takes the following form:

- For `requirements.txt`

```
pandas==1.1.0
```

- For `environment.yml`

```
name: envname
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - pandas=1.1.0
```

### Setting up a virtual environment

We will present 2 options: using `virtualenv` or `conda`

#### Virtualenv

```
# Install virtualenv package
$ pip install virtualenv

# Create the virtual environment
$ virtualenv venv --python=python3.x

# Activate it
$ source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
$ source venv/bin/activate  # Unix
```

#### Conda

If you have a Miniconda installed:

```
# Create env
$ cd <this repository>
$ conda env create --file environment.yml

# Activate your environment:
$ conda activate envname

# Check python:
(envname) $ which python # Unix
(envname) $ where python # Windows

# In order to stop using this virtual environment:
(envname) $ deactivate
```

Once activated, the command line starts with (`envname`) to let you know which environment you're in. The environment must always be activated while working in the project.

### Handle dependencies

In your base environment, there should not be any Python packages. This isolates the dependencies of any project, avoiding future compatibility problems. Therefore, you must always install dependencies from within your virtual environment.

#### Virtualenv

```
$ source venv/bin/activate  # Activate env
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to amend the dependencies of the project, then simply run:

```bash
(venv) $ pip install mypackage
# You can have an exhaustive view of your environment:
(venv) $ pip list | grep pandas
pandas (1.1.0)
```

You should not forget to add this new dependence to `requirements.txt`.

#### Conda

If the name is correctly specified in the `environment.yml` file, then there is no need to run the following command from within the virtual environment:

```
conda env update --file environment.yml --prune
```

If you need to amend the dependencies of the project, then simply run:

```
$ conda activate envname  # Activate env
(envname) $ conda install -c conda-forge jupyter
(envname) $ conda list | grep python
python                    3.8.8           h4e93d89_0_cpython    conda-forge
```

You should not forget to add this new dependence to `environment.yml`. To get the best of both words, our recommended way is:

- All requirements need to be exported in a `requirements.txt` as explained in the `virtualenv` section above
- Use `environment.yml` to specify your environement name, your python and pip version and get packages dependencies directly from `requirements.txt`

```
dependencies: # Versions should be taken care of
  - python=3.10
  - pip=23.2.1
  - pip:
    - -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using `requirements.in`

Another more robust approach to keeping track of your dependencies is to have a `requirements.in` file and use `pip-compile` to compile your requirements. This allows you to keep only the dependencies that are actually imported in your code in the requirements and avoid overly complex requirements files.

- Creat a `requirements.in` with the packages imported in your code, specifying the version (example: `pandas==1.0.1`)
- Overwrite `requirements.txt` file by re-generating it:

```
(venv) $ pip-compile requirements.in
```

This will automatically parse all your nested dependencies into `requirements.txt` thus ensuring full reproducibility. The only caveats are that it:
- Requires an additional package, [`pip-tools`](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools)
- Takes some time to compile long and complex requirements
- Does not integrate well with the `environment.yml` approach for `conda`

### Conda VS Pip

*TL;DR*: use conda.

These two resources are worth reading:

- Stack Overflow: [What is the difference between Pip and Conda](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20994716/what-is-the-difference-between-pip-and-conda)
- Anaconda blog: [Understanding the difference between Conda and Pip](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/understanding-conda-and-pip)

### Demo

- Let's create a new environment to run our hello world project using the `install_env.sh` script. Make sure you are at `best-practices` and run:

```bash
pip install pip-tools
```

```bash
bash bin/install_env.sh
```

```bash
conda activate foo-env
```

## Locally check your code

You now have a functioning local environment where you can develop python code. Still, it is common for us to make silly mistakes while coding. Over time, these mistakes can compound and add up to a large unexpected failure or just a general decline in code quality. We can employ simple and effective tools to help us overcome these small mistakes when developing.

### Linting

*Linters* perform a *static* evaluation of the code to look for bugs and errors. They are useful as they help in identifying potential issues in the code before it is run. As they perform static evaluation, they cannot catch any RunTime errors. However, a linter can check for syntax errors, type mismatches, and code smells. The most used linters in Python include:

- [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/)
- [Pyflakes](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/)
- [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
- [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

Each linter has its own way of functioning and caveats, so choosing which one might be a matter of just sticking to what your pairs already use or looking for a specific feature. In this repo, we use `flake8` whose configuration can be found in `./.flake8`

### Demo

- Go to `best-practices` folder and lint the `best-practices` folder using flake8

```bash
flake8 .
```

### Automatic Formatting

Good formatting is essential to ensure that your code is readable and comprehensible. However, it is probably the area of coding in which it is the easiest to make a mistake. That is why we generally use tools that format the code automatically, ensuring that we are always PEP compliant. The most used tool for this end is [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). We also often use a tool to organize imports in a logical manner called [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/). The configuration for both tools can be found in the `./pyproject.toml` file.

There are other commonly used tools like [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) and [bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that provide different functionalities, but that have not been used in this project.

### Demo

- Run `isort` to format the imports

```bash
isort .
```

- Run `black` to format the code
```bash
black .
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Git provides a useful tool to help putting these technique into practice. Pre-commit hooks allow you to perform these code checks every time you make a commit. The `pre-commit` packages helps to use this tool, by creating a customizable config file for the pre-commits. You can find it [here](./.pre-commit-config.yaml).

Before using the pre-commits, you must install them, by running in your terminal:

```bash
pre-commit install -t pre-commit
```

### Demo

- Create a commit with the changes and see that all check pass

## Git

Working with a clean and legible git history is key to rendering your commit history usable. The whole point of using `git` is to keep track of the changes in code and collaborate better. Achieving that requires establishing rules that go beyond the simple practices we keep when working alone.

## Continuous Integration

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves frequently integrating code changes made by multiple developers into a shared repository. The main goal of CI is to streamline and automate the process of integrating code, running tests, and identifying and fixing bugs early in the development cycle. CI ensures that all changes are tested and incorporated into the main codebase in a consistent and reliable manner. It helps in maintaining code quality, reducing integration issues, and enhancing collaboration among team members. By automating the integration process, CI also enables faster feedback loops, making it easier to catch and resolve issues promptly, leading to improved software stability and quicker delivery of new features. Overall, CI is essential for achieving efficient, robust, and reliable software development.

Common checks performed by a Continuous Integration (CI) system include:

- **Code compilation:** This is the first step in many CI pipelines. The code is compiled to check for any syntax errors.
- **Unit testing:** These are the tests written by developers to check the functionality of a small piece of code or a "unit". The CI system runs these tests to ensure that the new changes have not broken any existing functionality.
- **Integration testing:** These tests check the interaction between different units of code. They are run to ensure that the units of code work correctly when integrated.
- **Static code analysis:** This involves checking the code for potential errors, bugs, or deviations from coding standards without executing the program.
- **Security testing:** This involves checking the code for potential security vulnerabilities, like secrets leaking

### CICD and Github Actions

Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and GitHub Actions are all practices and tools used in modern software development to automate the process of integrating code changes, testing, and deployment.

CD is a step further than CI and involves the automated delivery of the integrated code to the production environment. It ensures that the software can be released at any time. While CI deals with the build and test stages of the development cycle, CD covers the deployment stages.

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a CI/CD tool provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your GitHub repository. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.

We included an example CI workflow in the [./.github/workflows/ci.yaml](./.github/workflows/ci.yaml) file. It does:

* Copy the current repo into the GitHub Action
* Set up python
* Install requirements: ensures there are no conflicts in the requirements
* Run pre-commit hooks: ensures developer installed pre-commit hooks and thus linted and formatted the code
